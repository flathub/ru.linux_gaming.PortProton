## üî® Building

To compile PortProton as a Flatpak, you'll need both [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) and [Flatpak Builder](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder.html) installed. Once you manage that, do the following...

0. Clone this repository and `cd` into it
1. Add the git submodules
   ```sh
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```
2. Compile the flatpak
   ```sh
   flatpak-builder --repo=portproton --force-clean --install-deps-from=flathub build-dir ru.linux_gaming.PortProton.yml
   ```
3. Add the local repo and install the flatpak
   ```sh
   flatpak remote-add portproton portproton --no-gpg-verify
   flatpak install portproton ru.linux_gaming.PortProton
   ```

## üìã FAQ

- PortProton cannot detect my MangoHud config if I used MANGOHUD_USER_CONF

   Add the adequate filesystem override
   ``` sh
   flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/MangoHud:ro ru.linux_gaming.PortProton
   ```

- What tarball downloaded in startup

   During the first run of PortProton the file PortWINE-master.tar.gz is downloaded, these are just scripts that are downloaded from gitlab or github, more details in [upstream](https://github.com/Castro-Fidel/PortProton_ALT/blob/main/portproton).

- Building custom wine version used in PortProton from source code

   All sources as well as tools for building custom versions of Wine (Wine LG) and Proton (Proton LG) used in PortProton can be found in the [wine buillds](https://github.com/Castro-Fidel/wine_builds) repository.

- What to do if PortProton does not follow the system theme

  ```sh
  flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0 ru.linux_gaming.PortProton
  flatpak override --user --env=GTK_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme | tr -d "'") ru.linux_gaming.PortProton
  ```
